# Image-deblurring-using-GAN-s
It uses a Neural Network to deblur the image. This neural network is generally used for image processing and it is called as Generative Adversarial Network. It uses perceptual loss and Wasserstein loss that helps in training the model better.
With new Neural Network like GANs, we can create a model of complex neural nets that can help in solving this problem. Using Generative Adversarial Networks,
Images can be deblurred with significant improvement in quality
